# Flex-sensor-controlled-car

### Flex Sensor-Controlled Vehicle  

This project features a toy car controlled by a flex sensor, where different finger movements translate into specific motion commands. Using an Arduino Uno, BO motors, and motor drivers, the system enables smooth and responsive movement. Wireless communication between the glove and the car ensures real-time control, making it an intuitive and interactive way to drive the vehicle without traditional controllers. ðŸš—ðŸ’¨
